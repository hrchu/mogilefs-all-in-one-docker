# About
`MAIO - MogileFS All In One` provides a way to set up a minimal [MogileFS](https://github.com/mogilefs/mogilefs-wiki) cluster without pain. Tracker, stored and tracker DB are instantiated in a single container. It is suitable for testing and developing scenarios. 

# Highlight
 - Based on the latest version: MogileFS-Server 2.73 / MogileFS-Utils 2.30 / MogileFS-Network 0.06 
 - All in one. No additional dependency. 
 - The domain/class is configurable.
 - Quality and compatibility - Continuous test and build against the latest Docker version
 - Contributor friendly - typical contribution process, no weird policies
 
# Howto
- docker pull hrchu/mogilefs-all-in-one
- docker run -e DOMAIN_NAME=testdomain -e CLASS_NAMES="testclass1 testclass2" -t -d -p 7001:7001 -p 7500:7500 --name maio hrchu/mogilefs-all-in-one

Now MogileFS is ready to war on port 7001/7500! ðŸ˜Ž

Artifacts is based on [Jeffutter](https://hub.docker.com/r/jeffutter/mogile-tracker)'s contribution. I enjoy his work for many years. However, he does not maintain it anymore. Besides, he removed all source code, so I decided to build a new one with many improvements.
